During the hackathon, we managed to implement quite a lot!  
We built a **procedurally generated world**, a **playable character with movement**, and a **fungal (mold) spread system** that dynamically changes the environment.  

We also added:
- 🧭 **Intro and world-building elements**
- 📖 **Storyline**
- 🎵 **Adaptive music** that evolves together with the spreading fungus
- 🌫️ **Dynamic environment changes** influenced by the mold

The result is a living, breathing world that feels mysterious and immersive.  

⚠️ **Note:**  
The game is still somewhat unstable — movement isn’t fully polished yet, so it’s possible to get stuck from time to time.  
But overall, we’re really proud of what we achieved in such a short time! 🚀  

🎨 **Credits & Tools:**  
All graphics were **hand-drawn by our very talented artist Lidka**.  
We used **AI tools to generate sound samples** (later refined and mastered) and to compose **the adaptive soundtrack**.  
AI also assisted us during the coding process, helping us move faster and experiment with ideas.
